Announcing N2YGK's Linux aprsdigi-2.4.4.		February, 2004

Release 2.4.4 of N2YGK's advanced APRS digipeater is now available for
free under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL) at
ftp://ftp.tapr.org/aprssig/linux/aprsdigi-2.4.4.tgz.

This release has the following new features:

As well as these existing features:
- Ability to specify a list of ports that get sent a verbatim duplicate copy
  of all packets received on a given port.  Useful for "reflecting" what's
  heard on an RF port to a local LAN for instance.

Added in 2.4.3:
- UDP/IP (v4 and v6) unicast and multicast (ASM) support.  Useful for 
  connecting aprsdigi's over the Internet, WLANs, etc.
  (Note: this is *not* TCP support as used by APRS-IS, aprsd, etc.)
  Both transparent and "3rd party" tunneling are supported.
- Budlist to permit/deny digipeating of traffic for individuals or groups of
  AX.25 and IP sources.  IP budlists are helpful when using IP multicast!
- Interfaces may be set to transmit- or receive-only.
- Interfaces may be set to disable retransmission of received packets on
  the same interface (one-armed routing).  
- Unix FIFO supported as an interface type.  Mostly useful for debugging.
- Bug fixed that caused aprsdigi to crash upon TRACEn-n callsign insertion
  when the digipeater list was full.

Added in earlier releases:
- Digipeater callsign substitution (e.g. RELAY replaced w/N0CLU-12).
- WIDE, WIDEn-n, TRACE, and TRACEn-n.
- As many radio interfaces as you can plug into your Linux machine
  with flexible gatewaying between them.
- Special handling for Mic-Encoder, Kenwood TH-D7, and TheNet X1J4, including
  SSID-based digipeating.
- Suppression of duplicate and looping packets.
- Works with Linux 2.4 kernel AX.25 network stack.  This means any AX.25
  interface supported by the kernel will work, not just a TNC2 clone.
  Examples include all the BAYCOM interfaces (BAYPAC, PICPAR, PICSER, etc.),
  soundcards, 8530 SCC cards, any serial port KISS TNC, etc.
